* Mission Statement:  To make coding as social and as fun as possible, while learning about modern tools and programming 
languages.   
* Language: We will use the programming language Codea, buit on Lua to learn basic coding skills while making games for IPad.
* CM: We will use github to manage CM.  The plan is to perform traditional clone/edit/commit on a desktop or laptop PC.  Reviews,
commentary, etc will occur in either  of the ForkHub or GitHub apps on Android, or the ioctocat app on IOS.
