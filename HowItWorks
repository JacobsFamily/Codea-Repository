* Mission Statement:  To make coding as social and as fun as possible, while learning about modern tools and programming 
languages.   
* Language: We will use the programming language Codea, built on Lua, to learn basic coding skills while making games for IPad.
* CM: We will use github to manage CM.  The plan is to perform traditional clone/edit/commit on a desktop or laptop PC.  Reviews,
commentary, etc will occur in either  of the ForkHub or GitHub apps on Android, or the ioctocat app on IOS. 
* Process:
  * Use ipad or mobile phone to monitor changes to the JacobsFamily repository
  * Fork and/or branch the repository to create a copy of the repository on a branch
  * The branch should have the issue number in its name
  * Switch the repository from master to the newly created branch name.
  * If there is an issue assigned to you, you can do the following:
    * Read the issue thoroughly, including any hints contained there
    * Clone (manually with copy and paste) the codea code over to the ipad
    * Make the change to 1 or more files in Codea and test thoroughly
    * Once satified with the test, you can switch to firefox (because file editing is still not a feature in the app), 
    edit the file and copy and paste the code from codea into the file.
    * Once done, commit the file to the branch
    * Repeat for any other files that require changes
    * Once all of your changes are committed to the branch in github, start a pull request.
    * JacobsFamily members will review and/or approve the request.  Hit the merge button once the members are happy
    with the review.
  * Once the code is back in master, you may delete the branch.
