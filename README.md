# Codea-Repository
This is where Codea Projects will reside.
The projects will clone selected sample projects currently shipped with Codea distribution (such as BitInvader).  
The family will then take turns gradually playing with the code as a way to learn coding and distributed CM.
We will clone the repository to the ipad (just cut and paste), make changes and test within Codea, and when satified, copy the changes over to a github branch, commit and initiate pull request. Then all members of the Organization will review, and if the review is good, we'll complete the change with the merge to master.
